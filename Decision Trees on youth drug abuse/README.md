## Youth Drug Use Analysis
This project aims to explore patterns and factors influencing drug use among teenagers, leveraging the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) dataset. Through a series of machine learning models, we investigate three key aspects:

**Binary Classification:** Predict whether teenagers have ever used marijuana.

**Multiclass Classification:** Classify the frequency of marijuana use among teenagers in the past year.

**Regression:** Estimate the age at which individuals first started smoking cigarettes.

**Key Findings**

**Binary Classification:** The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.91% in predicting teenage marijuana use, with social factors like peer influence and parental attitudes being crucial predictors.

**Multiclass Classification:** Gradient Boosting and Pruned Decision Trees performed best (88.5% accuracy) in classifying the frequency of teenage marijuana use, with features like standard marijuana frequency and frequency of use being highly influential.

**Regression:** The Random Forest model outperformed other models with the lowest test MSE of 5.473 in estimating the age of first cigarette use, with variables like education level and youth activities playing a significant role.

By examining the influential factors and decision pathways obtained from tree-based models, this analysis provides valuable insights for developing targeted interventions and legislation aimed at addressing teenage substance abuse.
